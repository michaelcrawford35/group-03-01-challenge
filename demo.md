## About Nick
Nick joined programming per the influence of his own father.  An interesting fact, his father joined programming from his **HIS** 
own father as well! Currently, Nick is finishing his degree- and will soon be joining Cerner as a backend or fullstack developer!
Why did he choose programming? Simple. Nick wants to change the world. People typically overlook the contributions of software development
but if you took a single moment to discern how profoundly your life would be without software you would quickly appreciate the changes
of these unsung heroines! I am always late to things.

## About Chase
The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. 
[beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding]

## About Matthew
Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. 
The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. 
The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.

##Thanks for comming!
